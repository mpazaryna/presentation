# Private Intelligence for Modern Practices

- Building solutions that don't depend on frontier models

---

# About Me

- Independent Developer 
- I've worked over 35 years in enterprise development and start ups
- Currently focused on optimizing agentic development 
- Building domain independent applications and workflows

---

# Why Apple Native

- Apple Foundation Models are available on 30+ devices
- MLX Framework allows models to be trained on Apple Silicon
- Privacy First Approach to data
  
---

# How I Built the application (in 3 weeks)

- Learn MLX framework
- Learn SwiftUI
- Learn xCode

---

# Collecting Source Materials

- **Collect** - Practitioner notes 
- **Build** - Synthetic notes to extend clinical range

---

# Process Source Materials

- **Extract** - Parse notes for findings, anatomical references, treatment codes
- **Transform** - Create terminology mappings from practitioner language 
- **Output** - Tensors aka optimized vectors

---

# How Tensors Become Models

- **Input** - Tensors 
- **Transform:** - Using the MLX framework
- **Output:** - Custom and specialized models 

---

# Application Workflow: Exam

**Input:** Examination 

---

# Application Workflow: Exam → Process

- 3 Models Run in Parallel (<50ms)
- ICD Classifier detects codes M54.5, M99.03
- Vertebral Detector detects L4-L5 lumbar segments
- CPT Classifier detects code 98940, 97110

---

# Application Workflow: Exam → Process → Output

- Subjective: Clinical narrative
- Assessment: Diagnoses with ICD codes
- Plan: Procedures with CPT codes + treatment details

---
